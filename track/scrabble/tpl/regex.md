- You are compiling a *static regular expression* in a function that will most likely be called several times. Could 
you have a look at the section about `regular expressions` below and change your code accordingly? 
My recommendation would be to run the provided benchmarks before and after you optimize your code to see
what effect a change has. See the `benchmarks` section for that.
